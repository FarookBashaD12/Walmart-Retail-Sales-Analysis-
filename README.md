# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## Project Objective

This project focuses on analyzing Walmart store sales data using **Python** and **Pandas** in a **Jupyter Notebook**. The goal is to identify trends, understand seasonal effects, evaluate sales by store and department, and extract key business insights to support data-driven decision making.

---

## Dataset Used

- **Walmart Sales Dataset** (contains features like store number, department, weekly sales, holidays, temperature, fuel price, and CPI)

---

## Key Business Questions

- Which store has the highest sales?
- What is the impact of holidays on sales?
- How do different departments perform over time?
- Are there seasonal trends in sales?
- How does temperature or fuel price affect weekly sales?

---

## Process Followed

- Imported and cleaned data using **Pandas**
- Explored missing values, data types, and unique identifiers
- Performed EDA: grouped by store, department, and dates
- Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Derived insights on holiday performance, temperature effect, and store-wise comparisons

---

## Key Insights

- **Store X** has the highest total sales overall
- Sales tend to **drop during holidays** in some stores while others peak
- There is a clear **seasonal trend**, with strong sales during certain months
- Departmental performance varies significantly by store
- Minor negative correlation between **temperature** and sales in colder regions

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ data cleaning & analysis  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â€“ visualization

---

## Final Conclusion

This analysis helps Walmart and similar retail chains:

- Identify high-performing stores and departments
- Adjust inventory and marketing strategies during holiday seasons
- Understand external factors (weather, fuel) influencing sales
